# CPP-COMP

## Vision

This is a command line inteface that helps me with my cpp projects. It runs on node js that helps compile all cpp files into an execution file. it can be configured, through a config.json file or through cli arguments

## Basics

So at the most basic level, this cli will take all .cpp files that it finds in a source folder, compiles them down to .o files, then the linker will do finish up the process and an execution file will be made.
