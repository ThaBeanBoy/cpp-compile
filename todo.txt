#Have to be installed:
    gnu/g++ compiler is used

    Astyles for formating

        Installing:

alot of help from https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/06/18/command-line-app-with-nodejs
helped in understanding the bin folder, and you have to install this globally for the CLI to work anywhere

c/c++ (Microsoft) extension has to be installed
#Compilation
    ><Compile all .cpp files in a directory
    ><Check if there is a source
    ><Check if there are .cpp files in a source
    ><Console out any errors from the compiler
    ><Check if g++ is there
    ><Check if the program is still running
    ><Format all .cppFiles

#Watch files
    ><Watch all .cpp and .h files ONLY!!!
    <> Watch new files

#Feedback
    <> Show the user that is currently compiling (Maybe add an animation)
    <> Show the user that their program has been compiled
    <> Show errors in the code

#Config file
	<>Import config
    <>Enable Watch from the config
    <>Ability to watch files that may not be a .cpp file - can take arr of filenames
	<>G++ C++ version
	<>Keep o files
	<>Source folder
	<>dont compile
	<>don't compile files (with name or directory)
	<>exec file name
	<>exec files
	<>format
	<>don't format
	<>log cmd executions

    <>If there's program still running, should we stop the execution and continue the compilation process or just stop the compilation process

#CLI Interactivity
    <>Ability to watch files that may not be a .cpp file - command eg. '*.txt'

#Class generator

#Library generator
    <>Generate header file
    <>Generate Implementataion file

#functions and header files watch thing
    <> Implementataion file is the one that edits the header file, then compilation is started
